                            final
                            beating Brazil at Estadio Maracana, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on 10 July 2021Reuters
                            Argentina won their first major title in 28 years on Saturday and Lionel Messi finally won
                            his
                            first medal in a blue-and-white shirt when an Angel Di Maria goal gave them a 1-0 win over
                            Brazil and a record-equalling 15th Copa America.

                            Di Maria, starting for just the second time in the Copa, justified his selection by scoring
                            the
                            opener midway through the first half.

                            Renan Lodi failed to cut out a long ball forward from Rodrigo De Paul and Di Maria lobbed
                            the
                            stranded Ederson with aplomb.

                            Brazil piled on the pressure in an exciting second half but even with five strikers on the
                            field
                            they could not get an equaliser against an Argentine defence protected by the outstanding
                            Rodrigo De Paul.

                            In the second half there was no contest - only one team tried to play football, the other
                            just
                            wasted time as we knew they would. It’s not an excuse, we didn’t do what we had to,
                            principally
                            in the first half
                            Thiago Silva, Brazilian defender
                            “First we have to congratulate our opponents especially for the first half when they
                            neutralised
                            us,” said Brazilian defender Thiago Silva.

                            “In the second half there was no contest - only one team tried to play football, the other
                            just
                            wasted time as we knew they would. It’s not an excuse, we didn’t do what we had to,
                            principally
                            in the first half.”

                            I knew my dream would come true, and where better than the Maracanazo and giving the title
                            to
                            the best in the world and fulfilling his dream
                            Emilian Martinez, Argentina Goalkeeper
                            Argentina’s win was a particular triumph for Barcelona striker Messi, who picked up his
                            first
                            ever title in a blue-and-white shirt after more than a decade of club and individual
                            honours.

                            The Argentine players surrounded their captain at the final whistle. Goalkeeper Emilian
                            Martinez
                            celebrated what he called a Maracanazo, a remarkable win at the famous Rio stadium.

                            “I’m speechless,” he said. “I knew my dream would come true, and where better than the
                            Maracanazo and giving the title to the best in the world and fulfilling his dream.”

                            Messi finished the tournament’s joint top goalscorer with four goals and was elected joint
                            best
                            player along with Neymar.

                            But he was quiet throughout the game at the Maracana stadium and uncharacteristically missed
                            a
                            golden opportunity to wrap the game up with two minutes remaining.

                            When the final whistle went, Argentina TV declared “Argentina Champions, Lionel Messi
                            Champion!”

                            The match itself was a disappointing one, with Argentina the better side in a cagey first
                            half
                            that featured 21 fouls.

                            However, Brazil came out more aggressively in the second period and as the time ticked on
                            they
                            threw more people forward - and at one point having five recognised strikers on the field.

                            Richarlison had a goal chalked off for offside seven minutes into the second half and then
                            forced Emiliano Martinez into a good stop two minutes later.

                            But as Brazil poured forward gaps, opened up and Argentina missed two clear chances to score
                            in
                            the dying moments of the match.

                            The victory was Argentina’s 15th Copa America triumph and means they draw level with Uruguay
                            as
                            the all-time leading winners.

                            “This is a very big title,” said Argentine coach Lionel Scaloni. “I hope that Argentines can
                            enjoy it. The fans love the team unconditionally and I think they identify with this side
                            that
                            never drops its guard.”

                            Their win extended their sequence of undefeated matches to 20 under Scaloni and handed
                            Brazil
                            their first competitive defeat since they lost to Belgium in the quarter-finals of the 2018
                            World Cup.</p>

                        <p class="news-details">Italy wrecked England’s Euro 2020 party at Wembley on Sunday, winning a
                            tense
                            final on penalties to plunge the host nation into despair and prolong their 55-year wait for
                            a second major title.

                            Roberto Mancini’s men recovered from the shock of conceding the quickest goal ever in a
                            European Championship final to equalise and held their nerve to claim a 3-2 shootout victory
                            after a 1-1 draw following extra-time.

                            It is the second time Italy have been crowned European champions and comes after the
                            embarrassment of failing even to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

                            Three players fluffed penalties for England, extending their poor record in shoot-outs and
                            leaving the hosts waiting for another major trophy after the 1966 World Cup.

                            “We did well,” Mancini told RAI Sport. “We conceded a goal straight away and struggled, but
                            then we dominated the game.

                            “The lads were wonderful, I don’t know what more to say. It’s important for all the people
                            and all the fans. I hope they’re celebrating (in Italy).”

                            in Rome on 11 July 2021AFP
                            Italians spilled into the streets from Milan to Palermo to celebrate their side’s triumph,
                            pushing aside thoughts of the coronavirus pandemic which has gripped the nation.

                            Earlier, a partisan crowd of more than 67,000 mostly England fans at Wembley was whipped
                            into a state of fever pitch by rousing renditions of “Three Lions” and “Sweet Caroline”
                            before kick-off.

                            Gareth Southgate’s team raced out of the blocks and were ahead in just the second minute
                            when defender Luke Shaw finished coolly at the back post after an inviting cross from Kieran
                            Trippier.

                            Italy grew stronger as the match went on and equalised with 23 minutes remaining when
                            Leonardo Bonucci scrambled the ball into the net from close range.

                            With four minutes remaining of normal time a pitch invader stopped the action and stewards
                            struggled to catch him, adding to a sense of chaos at the stadium after ticket-less fans
                            earlier forced their way in.

                            Normal time finished goalless despite a flurry of substitutions and the sides were still
                            locked at 1-1 after extra time.

                            England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford saved spot-kicks from Andrea Belotti and Jorginho but
                            Marcus Rashford hit the post and Gianluigi Donnarumma kept out Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka,
                            sparking scenes of delirium from the players and the small pocket of italian fans.

                            The atmosphere around Wembley was frenzied in the build-up to the match, which kicked off at
                            1900 GMT, with supporters draped in England colours downing pints of beer and chanting
                            anthems.

                            Footage posted on social media showed hundreds of supporters battling to get past lines of
                            stewards and police, with some able to force their way through security cordons and others
                            scaling walls.

                            Another video appeared to show violent clashes between fans inside Wembley itself.

                            London’s Metropolitan Police said officers made 45 arrests while managing the final.

                            On another sour note, police said they would be investigating “offensive and racist” social
                            media posts directed at Rashford, Sancho and Saka, who all failed from the spot.

                            A Football Association spokesman said: “The FA strongly condemns all forms of discrimination
                            and is appalled by the online racism that has been aimed at some of our England players on
                            social media.”

                            Italy unbeaten

                            Italy had been arguably the team of the tournament heading into the final, sweeping through
                            the group stage with a perfect record before knocking out Austria, top-ranked Belgium and
                            Spain to reach the final.

                            Revitalised since Mancini took over after their failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup,
                            the Azzurri are now unbeaten in 34 matches.

                            The four-time world champions’ lone previous European Championship triumph came in 1968.
                            They were beaten finalists in 2000 and 2012.

                            England fans will have to come to terms with a painful defeat just when it seemed they were
                            on the brink of ending their tournament drought, stretching all the way back to the 1966
                            World Cup, which they won on home soil.

                            Southgate has revolutionised the national side since taking charge in 2016, leading his team
                            to the semi-finals of the World Cup in Russian three years ago.

                            The manager, who missed a penalty in the Euro 96 semi-final against Germany, urged England
                            to use the pain to fuel success in the future, accepting the blame for the heartbreaking
                            penalty shoot-out defeat.

                            “I said we could have no recriminations,” he said. We win and lose together. They’ve got to
                            walk away from here with their heads held high.

                            “They’ve done more than any other team in the last 50 or so years. In terms of the players,
                            they should be incredibly proud of what they’ve done.”</p>
